# Welcome to my Backend-Series 

**Backend-Series** is a day by day backend learning repository reflects my consistent practice 
and growth in backend development through real, hands on implementation.

## About This Repository

* This series is built around the idea of **learning by doing**.  
* Each day focuses on a specific backend concept, implemented practically using real world patterns such as APIs, database operations, and server configuration.
* Rather than isolated examples, the work here follows a gradual and structured learning path to build strong backend fundamentals.
* Each folder includes a well documented **README** that clearly explains what was learned and implemented in a simple and easy to understand way on that specific day.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Daily backend learning logs and practice (Day wise folders)
- Hands on practice with backend concepts
- Step by step progress through real world backend concepts
- Hands on implementation rather than only notes
- Gradual movement towards production level backend understanding
- Clean project structure and readable code

## Learning Goal

The goal of this repository is to develop a **solid backend foundation** by:
- Writing real backend logic
- Understanding how servers, APIs, and databases work together
- Practicing industry relevant workflows
- Building confidence through daily consistency

## Inside each day, you’ll find:

- Source code
- Configuration files
- A dedicated README explaining what was learned that day

## 🗂 Repository Structure

Each folder represents one day of learning:
```bash
