# This is Day-12 of Learning Backend.

* Day-12 was fully dedicated to **practicing and revising** the work done in previous day.  
* Today focus was on repeating the same flow to strengthen understanding and improve confidence.
* Repeating the same concepts helped build stronger fundamentals and ensured the learning from previous days is well understood before moving forward.


## 📘 What I Did Today

- Re practiced frontend to backend **CRUD operations**
- Repeated the complete flow of UI → Backend → Database → UI
- Worked again on creating, updating, and deleting notes from the UI
- Focused on improving clarity in code structure and logic
- Paid attention to understanding how each part works together
- Used repetition to identify gaps and fix small mistakes

## Why This Practice Was Important

This practice day helped reinforce:
- How frontend actions trigger backend APIs
- How backend logic communicates with the database
- How a full stack setup behaves when everything is connected
- Better confidence in handling CRUD based applications

## What’s Next

With a solid understanding of CRUD and full stack flow, the next step is to move towards **user based features** (Authentication and Authorization)
and deeper backend concepts, focusing on building more structured and secure applications.
