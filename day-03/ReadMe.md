1. Today, I used **Postman** to test, create, and manage APIs.
2. I learned HTTP methods like **GET** and **POST**.
3. I understood how data is sent in a request and how the server sends a response.
4. I tested APIs using different endpoints and URLs.
5. I learned how to send **JSON data** in the request body.
